# Sorting all numbers in descending order is the simplest solution that occurs to us. But this doesn't work.
# For example, 548 is greater than 60, but in the output, 60 comes before 548. As a second example, 98 is greater
# than 9, but 9 comes before 98 in the output. The solution is to use any comparison-based sorting algorithm.
# Thus, instead of using the default comparison, write a comparison function myCompare() and use it to sort numbers.
# Given two numbers, X and Y, how should myCompare() decide which number to put first â€“
# we compare two numbers XY (Y appended at the end of X) and YX (X appended at the end of Y).
# If XY is greater, then, in the output, X should come before Y, else Y should come before X.
# For example, let X and Y be 542 and 60. To compare X and Y, we compare 54260 and 60542.
# Since 60542 is greater than 54260, we put Y first.
